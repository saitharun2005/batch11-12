Modules
Form validations

Modules :
=============
->Modules are like import/export code to another js files

 Named Modules : Definenly while importing should use the same name that you are defining exactly with in {} You can export as many modules of code that you want.

 Default Modules:  While importing can use any name that you want. You can export only one modules of code in one source file. You should use the default keyword while exporting.


Form validations: Validations are like checkers for values that user enters in each field in your form.

  1. Create a signup form that  contains
 username(!empty),
 email(@, !empty), 
password(should be 6) and 
confirm password(same as password value, !empty), 
once you click on submit button, a alert should be popped up on you screen "form is submitted successfully" if and only if all the validations are correct.
